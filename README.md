-Install the requirements.txt

-Performed Random-Oversampliing technique of Oversampling techniques to balance the dataset.

# LSTM model

# Download GloVe embeddings from: http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip
# Extract the zip file and place glove.6B.200d.txt in the 'glove' directory.
                            or
                  Use the attached file
                  
# Results
  -The model achieves an accuracy of 92% on the test set. The Streamlit app provides an easy-to-use interface for analyzing the sentiment of new product reviews.
